Training Spotify API possibilities.

This application makes it possible to get some information from user's Spotify account, including user information, saved playlist and songs. 
Every playlist can be saved to a .CSV file, in which for every song user can see Spotify-specific parameters such as song's danceability, energy, key, tempo, ID link and more.
